# SQLucid
The repo for SQLucid

SQLucid is an interactive interface for code generation. The frontend is based on [React](https://react.dev/), and the backend is based on [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/) and another project named [STEPS](https://github.com/magic-YuanTian/STEPS).

## How to set up the project
The entire project folder is large (around 5GB) including 2 pre-trained models and database files. You can choose to clone file locally and manually install corresponding files.

- For the frontend, you can run `npm install` (and other prompted missing packages) to install related packages under the frontend folder.

- For the backend, please use `pip install` for any missing packages. If you encounter any issues, please check the detailed environment [here](https://github.com/OhadRubin/SmBop).


**Suggested option**: You can also directly download the entire project folder through [this link](https://purdue0-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/tian211_purdue_edu/Ee2FCOD3QHtEiG6mEmZ2CtwBbk8x9hMRZ6d3aU6W3Xii_Q?e=XVWXYO)

## How to run
You should run the frontend and the backend in parallel.

First, start a terminal and run the following command:

```
cd SQLucid
cd frontend
```

Then, start another terminal and run

```
python3 run.py
```

Then, you can access SQLucid at `localhost:3000`
