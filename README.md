# SQLucid

SQLucid is an interactive interface for SQL generation, presented in the UIST'24 paper: 

[**SQLucid: Grounding Natural Language Database Queries with Interactive Explanations**](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3654777.3676368).

## 📌 Overview

SQLucid bridges the gap between non-expert users and complex database querying processes through three key features:
1. Editable step-by-step SQL explanations in natural language
2. Intermediate query results visualization
3. Visual correspondence highlighting

The project is built with:
- Frontend: [React](https://react.dev/)
- Backend: [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/) and [STEPS](https://github.com/magic-YuanTian/STEPS)


## 💫 Implementation

We offer two versions with different deployment approaches:

### V1 (Original Version)
This version is the one originally described in our paper.

- Includes a [text-to-SQL model](https://github.com/OhadRubin/SmBop) and our fine-tuned text-to-clause model.
- Project size: ~5GB (including 2 fine-tuned models and database files)
- For full backend deployment details, visit [STEPS](https://github.com/magic-YuanTian/STEPS)
- Download complete project (recommended): [V1 Download Link](https://purdue0-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/tian211_purdue_edu/Ee2FCOD3QHtEiG6mEmZ2CtwBbk8x9hMRZ6d3aU6W3Xii_Q?e=XVWXYO)

### V2 (Latest Version)
To support a more lightweight and up-to-date implementation, the latest version is powered by ChatGPT with a polished UI. 

- Powered by ChatGPT with enhanced UI
- More lightweight project: ~400MB
- Download complete project: [V2 Download Link](https://purdue0-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/tian211_purdue_edu/ESMZ-VgHhoFGuQl-w96EcSQBp1m0zqt6t3zVI8yiDaj14A?e=b0CTOR)
- Requires: Implementation of OpenAI API in `openai_api.py`, where the `get_openai_response()` method takes a string prompt and returns a string response.



## 🚀 Quick Start
After you deploy the project folder, you should run the *frontend* and the *backend* in parallel.

First, start a terminal and run the following command:

```
cd frontend
PORT=3000 npm start
```

Second, start another terminal and run

```
python run.py
```

Finally, you can access SQLucid at `localhost:3000`

    abstract = {Though recent advances in machine learning have led to significant improvements in natural language interfaces for databases, the accuracy and reliability of these systems remain limited, especially in high-stakes domains. This paper introduces SQLucid, a novel user interface that bridges the gap between non-expert users and complex database querying processes. SQLucid addresses existing limitations by integrating visual correspondence, intermediate query results, and editable step-by-step SQL explanations in natural language to facilitate user understanding and engagement. This unique blend of features empowers users to understand and refine SQL queries easily and precisely. Two user studies and one quantitative experiment were conducted to validate SQLucid’s effectiveness, showing significant improvement in task completion accuracy and user confidence compared to existing interfaces.
